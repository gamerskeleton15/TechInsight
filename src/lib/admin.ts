 * Admin authorization helpers for TechInsight.
 *
 * TechInsight is a single-publication blog. Only a small set of editors should
 * be able to log in, so the admin gate is driven by the ADMIN_EMAILS env var
 * (comma-separated) instead of a DB role column. This keeps bootstrap trivial:
 * add your email, deploy, log in once (auto-create), and you're an admin —
 * no one-off scripts or migrations required.
 *
 * Rules:
 *   - An email listed in ADMIN_EMAILS is an admin.
 *   - Admins can always reach /login and auto-create on first login.
 *   - Non-admins can log in ONLY if they already exist in the users table.
